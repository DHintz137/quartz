> “Until you make the unconscious concscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — Carl Jung

This my own personal garden of thoughts and ideas using Quartz [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought), a set of tools that allows hosting notes as a website for free, which was devoloped by lovey man by the name Jacky Zhao.
