# Welcome to my Digital Garden

> “Until you make the unconscious concscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — Carl Jung

This my own personal garden of thoughts and ideas using Quartz [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought), a set of tools that allows hosting notes as a website for free. Feel free to browse around. If you want to know me better, check out my About page.
