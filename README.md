# Welcome to my Digital Garden

> “Until you make the unconscious concscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — Carl Jung

This my own personal garden of thoughts and ideas using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/), a set of tools that allows hosting notes as a website for free. Feel free to browse around. If you want to know me better, check out my [About](https://dhintz137.github.io/quartz/About) page.
