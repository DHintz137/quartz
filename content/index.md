G'day!
```

I’m Dan, a Kiwi abroad pursuing a master's in statistics at the University of Wyoming and an aspiring data scientist. With four years of experience with scientific programming and mathematical and statistical modeling, my peers know me for my breadth and depth in modeling methodologies and translating them into concise scientific reports to bring about insights.

My academic background with a master’s in economics and, soon to be, a master's in statistics has given me strong theoretical underpinnings for the work I have completed in the field as a data scientist.  I have had multiple hands-on work experiences as a data scientist: a graduate researcher at the Advanced Research Computing Center at the University of Wyoming, an Intern bioinformatician at the Wyoming Public Health Lab, and an intern data scientist at Western EcoSystems Technologies.

I am passionate about working with domain experts to solve problems and guide them to the best modeling strategies for the job. I also love the comradery and personal growth that comes from collaborating with my peers. Sharing knowledge and experiences and jointly overcoming a challenge is a true joy.
