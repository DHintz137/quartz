The field of technical communication is rapidly evolving; the need for effective and clear technical writing has never been more crucial. A great way to ensure quality technical communication is via style guides. Below, I present two different style guides:

## Internal vs. External reports

### Internal Report Style Guide

#### Objective
The Internal Report Style Guide is designed for data science teams. It emphasizes detailed explanations, code transparency, and technical depth to facilitate collaboration, reproducibility, and in-depth understanding among team members.

#### Guidelines

1. **Code and Data Transparency:**
   - Include all code blocks and data processing steps.
   - Use clear and descriptive variable names.
   - Add comments to complex or non-obvious code segments.

2. **Detailed Explanations:**
   - Explain the rationale behind each analytical decision.
   - Provide context for the chosen methods and their relevance to the problem.
   - Discuss alternative approaches considered and reasons for their rejection.

3. **Comprehensive Analysis:**
   - Present full statistical analyses, including exploratory data analysis, assumptions testing, and model diagnostics.
   - Include all relevant plots and tables with detailed interpretations.
   - Report both successful and unsuccessful results to share learnings.

4. **Technical Depth:**
   - Delve into the technicalities of algorithms and statistical methods used.
   - Provide mathematical formulations where necessary.
   - Discuss the computational complexity and performance implications of the methods.

5. **Reproducibility:**
   - Ensure that scripts are executable and can be run independently.
   - Use version control systems for code and document the software environment.
   - Include seeds in stochastic processes for consistent results.

6. **Collaborative Features:**
   - Encourage peer review and annotations within the report.
   - Include a Q&A or discussion section for team feedback.
   - Utilize collaborative tools for simultaneous editing and commenting.

#### Presentation
- Format: Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown preferred for interactive elements and code integration.
- Language: Technical but accessible to all team members with varying expertise.
- Structure: Logical flow with clearly defined sections, headings, and subheadings.


### External Report Style Guide

#### Objective
The External Report Style Guide is tailored for clients or non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on clear, concise, and impactful communication of findings, implications, and recommendations without overwhelming technical details.

#### Guidelines

1. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
   - Use plain language and avoid technical jargon.
   - Summarize key findings at the beginning of the report.
   - Be brief and to the point, focusing on results and implications.

2. **Visuals and Accessibility:**
   - Use visuals (charts, graphs) to illustrate key points.
   - Ensure that visuals are self-explanatory with clear labels and legends.
   - Opt for a clean and professional layout.

3. **Context and Relevance:**
   - Provide background information to set the context.
   - Highlight the relevance of the findings to the clientâ€™s objectives or business goals.
   - Use real-world examples or scenarios to illustrate points.

4. **Actionable Insights:**
   - Translate technical findings into actionable business insights.
   - Provide clear and practical recommendations based on the analysis.
   - Discuss potential implications and suggest next steps.

5. **Limitations and Assumptions:**
   - Acknowledge the limitations of the analysis.
   - Clearly state any assumptions made during the analysis.
   - Discuss the potential impact of these limitations and assumptions on the findings.

6. **Executive Summary:**
   - Include an executive summary that encapsulates the key findings, recommendations, and business implications.
   - Ensure the summary is understandable without reading the full report.

#### Presentation
- Format: PDF or Word Document for formality and ease of distribution.
- Language: Non-technical, emphasizing clarity and readability.
- Structure: Well-organized with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.


Both style guides serve distinct purposes: the Internal Guide for in-depth technical collaboration and the External Guide for clear, impactful communication with stakeholders.
